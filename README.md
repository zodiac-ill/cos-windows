# COS Windows

This is a version of qimiko's [Click On Steps](https://github.com/qimiko/click-on-steps) mod for Windows users.

This version gets timestamps for inputs in the same way that CBF gets inputs: Open a raw input window and continously check for messages. qimiko did not want to do this as it would not allow for controller support, so a different implementation was used. Unfortunately this implementation is problematic for Windows users and they experience frequent crashes.

This implementation sacrifices controller support (and all of the mod's original settings options) for Windows functionality.

I TAKE CREDIT FOR NOTHING!!! This is qimiko's mod and the code that was changed was mostly just borrowed from [Click Between Frames](https://github.com/theyareonit/Click-Between-Frames)
